# QuizApp
IM2073 Mobile App Programming Mini Project. 
Tasked to combine web app and mobile app to develop a mobile "Clicker" system

# Use Case
1) Instructor shows a MCQ with options
2) Students select an option from their mobile phones
3) Instructor displays the statistics on his console

# Additional Features Added
- Create an activity for students to log-in to the system (Number Generated Code)
- Keeping track of questions, e.g., in the MCQ panel, create two buttons "Start" and     
  "Stop" and capture all responses between the start and stop times, for that particular 
  question.
- User (mobile phone) registration
